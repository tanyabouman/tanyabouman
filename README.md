# Hi, I'm Tanya Bouman ðŸ‘‹

Some of my contributions:

- **First PR**: Added documentation and type signatures on a Haskell project for an assignment in a Computer Science communication skills course.  https://github.com/spell-music/amsterdam/pull/1
- **First PR for work**: A simple and satisfying bug fix for a CiviCRM plugin. https://github.com/eileenmcnaughton/org.wikimedia.contacteditor/issues/5
- **Most PRs to a single open source repository** (I think): [Tanya Bouman's PRs to Hugo template for Decap CMS with Netlify Identity](https://github.com/decaporg/one-click-hugo-cms/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atanyabouman+)  I contributed because this template is the closest thing that I've found to a nice static site that has an easy way for non-technical people to edit the content.  Another interesting project for static sites is Elm Pages, and I contributed some documentation for that.

- **Longest conversation before merge** (I think): It looked like a simple bug fix, but it reverted a previous fix, so a reviewer required a test to prevent regressions. Then a reviewer pointed out that the bug fix was incomplete, and the second fix also required a test. https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12707
- **A bad PR**: A week before the PR, I had made an issue about a Bazel Gazelle feature I wanted, but didn't wait for any feedback.  Without getting the feedback, I didn't have enough context to realize why my idea wouldn't work.  That was a waste of effort, and it was not merged. Lesson learned. https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1054
